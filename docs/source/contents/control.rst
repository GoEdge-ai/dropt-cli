Project Control
===============

User sends command to a project via control script ``droptctl``.
To use it, one must install our Python client package first:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install dropt-cli


Basic Syntax
------------

Here is the basic syntax of ``droptctl``:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ droptctl -s ADDRESS -p PORT -t TOKEN CMD

* ``ADDRESS`` and ``PORT`` indicate which Dr.Opt server ``droptctl`` will connect to.
  If not given, `default Dr.Opt server <https://dropt.goedge.ai>`_ will be used.

* ``TOKEN`` is the unique identification of each user.
  It can be found on one's own **My account** page.

* ``CMD`` is the control command.  Currently, ``droptctl`` supports two commands:

  - **create**
  - **resume**


Create
------

.. code-block:: shell

   $ droptctl -t TOKEN create -c CONFIG_FILE

Create and run a new project based on config file ``CONFIG_FILE``,
which is assumed to be ``config.json`` if option ``-c`` is missing.


Resume
------

Dr.Opt allows user to resume a project if interrupted.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ droptctl -t TOKEN resume

A prompt will show all ongoing projects and user selects one to resume.

.. code-block:: shell
   
   ? Which project would you like to resume?  (Use arrow keys)
