# ImageNet in PyTorch
This example demonstrates an image classification model on PyTorch,
which is based on the [official PyTorch ImageNet example][ref:imagenet].
The default dataset is [tiny-imagenet-200][ref:ti200].


## Run model script
Simply enter the following command to train/evaluate the model with default
hyper-parameter configuration.
